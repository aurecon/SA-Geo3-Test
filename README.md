# Speckle Automate Template for Aurecon

This is the template for base all Aurecon Speckle Automate Functions from in the future. This template will have our package manager integrated within it.

## How to get started?

Create a new Function through Speckle Automate then copy paste this repository into that structure. Next open `.github/workflows/main.yml` and uncomment the lines at the bottom of the file. Then you are all set, the function logic is in `function/Function.cs` and unit testing is in `tests` folder.

## How do I release a new version to Speckle Automate?

Just push a new commit to the `main` branch, CI/CD should do the rest for you
